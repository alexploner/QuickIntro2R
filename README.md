# QuickIntro2R

This is a short introduction to using R/RStudio, assuming little or no previous exposure. 

The PDF document comes with a number of example data files and example scripts. The data can be used to replicate the 
commands used in the document, and to run the example scripts. 

This introduction was originally written for the course [Omics Data Analysis](https://kiwas.ki.se/katalog/katalog/kurs/2383) 
at Karolinska Institutet, but is fairly generic and should work reasonably well for anyone with a basic statistics background.
