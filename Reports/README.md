# Compiled draft reports

This directory contains draft reports generated from the script `omicsExample1.R` in RStudio:

1. Open the script in the RStudio code editor pane (e.g. via `Ctrl-O`)

2. Adjust the directory in the `setwd`-command so that it points to your copy of the data set.

3. Start complilation by clicking on the `Compile report` icon in the editor menu bar (notebook), or press `Ctrl-Shift-K`.

4. Choose the desired output format (PDF requires a working LaTeX installation).
